# FlockingBehaviorSimulation
A Python implementation of Craig Reynolds' Flocking Model to simulate the complex, adaptive behaviors of a flock. This project explores the principles of Social and Collective Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) through practical tasks, including behavior modifications and obstacle avoidance.


# Flocking Behavior Simulation

## Overview
This Python project simulates flocking behavior using Craig Reynolds' model, demonstrating Social and Collective Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) principles. It showcases how simple rules can produce complex group dynamics, akin to natural bird flocks.

## Features
- Implements the Boid model for agent-based simulation.
- Simulates cohesion, alignment, and separation behaviors.
- Tests with varying boid counts to study emergent patterns.
- Enhancements for realism, including speed adjustments and obstacle avoidance.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and run the simulation:
:

git clone https://github.com/pk-suddo/FlockingBehaviorSimulation.git
cd FlockingBehaviorSimulation
python Flock.py


## Tasks and Observations
Explore basic flocking behaviors, modifications for dynamic interactions, and the impact of obstacle avoidance.

## Modifications and Results
- Speed adjustments for proximity and more dynamic flocking.
- Obstacle avoidance for added complexity.

## Conclusion
A fascinating look at how simple rules govern complex systems, highlighting AI's potential in studying collective behaviors.
